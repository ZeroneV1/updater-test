# undergr0und - Web Game Launcher & Viewer

undergr0und is a custom web-based application designed to provide a simple and accessible platform for launching and viewing online games and websites, with a focus on circumventing internet censorship. It features a clean interface, a built-in viewer, a personalized library for favorites, and customizable themes.

## Features

* **Game Launcher:** Easily access a curated list of web games.
* **Integrated Viewer:** Play games and browse websites directly within the app using an iframe overlay.
* **Proxy Support:** (Where configured for specific games/sites) Access blocked content via a built-in proxy mechanism.
* **Personal Library:** Save your favorite games and websites to a dedicated library.
* **Recently Viewed:** Keep track of the websites and games you've recently accessed.
* **Customizable Themes:** Personalize the app's appearance with different color themes.
* **Dynamic News Feed:** Stay updated with news fetched from an external source.

* **Drag and Drop:** Reorder games on the Games page using drag and drop.
* **Add Custom Games:** Easily add new web games to your launcher.

## How to Use

1.  Open the `Launcher.html` file in a modern web browser.
2.  Navigate through the different sections using the sidebar icons (Home, Library, Viewer, Games, Updater, Settings, About).
3.  On the **Home** page, you can see the Game of the Day and the latest news. Use the search bar to quickly launch a URL in the viewer.
4.  On the **Games** page, click on a game card to launch it in the viewer. You can add games, favorite them, toggle proxy (if available), and reorder them by dragging and dropping.
5.  The **Library** page shows your favorited websites/games and your recently viewed history.
6.  Use the **Viewer** icon to open the viewer overlay directly to input a URL.
7.  In **Settings**, you can change the application's theme and reset your saved data.
8.  The **About** page provides information about the application and credits.
9.  Click the **Changelog** button (available on Home and About pages) to see the update history.

## Setup

1.  Download or obtain the `Launcher.html` file and any associated assets (like image files if you separate them later).
2.  The application fetches news from `https://hostfilez.glitch.me/news.txt` and the changelog from `https://hostfilez.glitch.me/changelog.txt`. You will need to set up these files on a web server or a service like Glitch for the news and changelog features to work.
3.  Modify the `news.txt` and `changelog.txt` files on your server to update the content in the app.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** The core web technologies.
* **Vanta.js:** For the animated background effects (uses Three.js).
